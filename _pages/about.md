I am an oceanographerï¼Œmy research focuses on the effects
of ocean surface waves on air-sea momentum and heat fluxes, and their influences
on the atmospheric boundary layer and extreme processes such as tropical cyclone.

I am also a modeler. Over the past few years, I have been working on the development
of an Atmosphere-Ocean-Wave coupled model known as [FIO-AOW](https://github.com/Biao-Zhao/FIO-AOW).

The goal of my research is to better understand the air-sea-wave coupled processes and to improve tropical 
cyclone and wind energy predictions.
