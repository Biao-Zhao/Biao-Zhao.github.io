I am an oceanographer, and my research focuses on the effects
of ocean surface waves on air-sea momentum and heat fluxes, as well as their influences
on processes in both ocean and atmosphere.

I am also a modeler. Over the past few years, I have been working on the development
of an Atmosphere-Ocean-Wave coupled model known as [FIO-AOW](https://github.com/Biao-Zhao/FIO-AOW).

The goal of my research is to better understand the air-sea-wave coupled processes and to improve the predictions related to tropical 
cyclone and wind energy.
