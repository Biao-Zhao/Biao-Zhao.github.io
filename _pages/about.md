I am an oceanographer specializing in the effects of ocean surface waves on the upper ocean and air-sea fluxes, with a particular focus on their 
influence during extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones. My work explores how these interactions affect both oceanic and atmospheric processes.

As a modeler, I have spent recent years developing the Atmosphere-Ocean-Wave coupled model, FIO-AOW [FIO-AOW](https://github.com/Biao-Zhao/FIO-AOW), to better capture the complexities of these air-sea-wave 
coupled processes. My research aims to enhance our understanding of these dynamics and improve simulations of ocean and atmosphere systems.
