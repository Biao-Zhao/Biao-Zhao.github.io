I am an oceanographer specializing in the effects of ocean surface waves on the upper ocean and air-sea fluxes, with a particular focus on their 
influence during extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones. My work explores how these interactions affect both oceanic and atmospheric processes.

As a modeler, I have spent recent years developing the Atmosphere-Ocean-Wave coupled model, [FIO-AOW](https://github.com/Biao-Zhao/FIO-AOW), to better capture the complexities of these air-sea-wave 
coupled processes. My research aims to enhance our understanding of these dynamics and improve simulations of ocean and atmosphere systems. 

Sometimes, I find myself as a modeler in a room full of oceanographers and an oceanographer in a room full of modelers. But I view this dual perspective as a unique opportunity to bridge these fields, constantly learning and adapting to enrich my understanding of complex ocean-atmosphere interactions
